The reason for specializing the sum() member function is to make sure that the strings 
are properly concatenated because the plus (+) operator will assume that the value passed 
will be integers only.

The reason for specializing the initial value for a summation is to make sure that the 
initial value has a safe empty value. If this was omitted, the program could produce 
semantic errors.

The reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition is to prevent 
multiple-definition errors. A static class variable should only be defined once in the 
whole program. If it’s defined inside a class that is inside a header file, which is 
usually “included” in multiple source files, it would cause linker errors (multiple 
definition error).
