Reflection
The difference between the implementations of a composition and an aggregation is that composition 
has a stronger coupling between its classes than aggregation. Composition implements complete 
ownership between a composer object and a component object. Aggregation encourages the concept of 
“using” object between classes.

Composition needs to have move and copy functions to manage the resource, hence the Restaurant 
module. Aggregation does not manage the creation or destruction of the objects passed in the 
ConfirmationSender module therefore it does not need some of the constructors.
