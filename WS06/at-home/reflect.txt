OOP345 Workshop 6

Reflection

Although not required, using stringstream gave me a little bit of struggle
in figuring out how to properly use it. But when I got the hang of it, it was
very useful in my createInstance function.

We need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in the vector
because an iterator is an object that points to an element in the sequence.

Vector of Object could have been used in this workshop by using copy
constructor and assignment operators to copy and store the vehicles.
