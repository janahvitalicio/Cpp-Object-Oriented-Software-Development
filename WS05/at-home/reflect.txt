Reflection
Lambda functions are useful when it's only used once and does not need complex
algorithm. Functors are the go-to if the function is to be repeated and if the 
algorithm is more complicated.

I would output an error message, and force the program to stop. Comparing the 
two solution, generating an exception is better then manually outputting error
message, and stopping the program.

In order not to duplicate the logic, I would use a templated class that 
encourages polymorphism.

The compiler will automatically generate a default constructor if I did not have
the custom constructor. But because custom constructors were defined in the 
program, the compiler did not generate it automatically, and I had to create it
manually. Default constructors are needed because class members have to be
initialize at the start of the program. (We don't want the compiler to initialize
the class members on its own simply because we don't know what data is going to be
stored.)
