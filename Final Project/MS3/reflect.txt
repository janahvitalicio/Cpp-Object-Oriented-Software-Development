OOP345 Reflection

Understanding Milestone 3 was the most confusing for me,
but with the help of my professor and peers I was able to grasp
the purpose of Task and LineManager classes.

I became familiar with using deque through this milestone.
I was confused at first with front()/back()/pop_front()/pop_back,
and about which one to use for certain functions,but I understood
that it all depends on the objects that you're manipulating, and how
you want them to be stacked, so it all worked out in the end.

As I expected, OOP345 is harder than OOP244 for me, but I'm glad to 
have learned and enchanced my C++/programming skills in this class.
