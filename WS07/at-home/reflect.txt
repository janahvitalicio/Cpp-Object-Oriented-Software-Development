Reflection

std::for_each() - I used this function because it allowed me to write lambda
                  expressions efficiently. 

std::sort() - This function was very easy to use and useful for sorting. It's
              more efficient than doing a manual sort.

The advantages of using STL algorithms vs. implementing the functionality
by myself using loops is efficiency, readability, and it's a time saver.

I would redesign the function by validating the received parameter first,
and throw an error if it's invalid.
