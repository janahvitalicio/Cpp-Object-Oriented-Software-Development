Reflection
The advantage that smart pointer syntax provides is that it can still be
treated as a raw pointer. In both of my += operator, I was able to dereference
my raw and smart pointer in the same way; using "*".

The difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in my solution can be
noticeable in my mergeRaw() functions. When allocating a dynamic memory of product,
to my raw pointer, I used an equal, "=", symbol. But I used parentheses, "()", when
allocating dynamic memory to my smart pointer. I also did not have to delete my
smart pointer compared to my raw pointer because smart pointers take care of 
their own destruction.
